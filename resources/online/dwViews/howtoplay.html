     <li>Player can choose to play against 1-4 players. The deck of cards is divided between the players</li>
     <br>
     <li >The first player starts by selecting their topmost card and selects an attribute. The value of that attribute is compared against the value for the same attribute in the other player's top card</li>
     <br>
     <li >The player with the best value for that attribute wins the round and the winner takes all the cards from that round (including their own) and places them at the back of their deck. If there is a draw the cards from the round are placed in a new communal pile and a new category is selected by the same player from the next card</li>
     <br>
     <li>The winner then takes the cards from the round and any in the communal pile. The winner of a round maintains the choice of category until they lose,then the choice moves to the next player</li>
     <br>
     <li>Players lose the game when they have no cards left;the player left with all the cards is the winner of the game!</li>
